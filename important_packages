#Do this stuff and obviously, don't forget to copy over the config files from github
#Also download San Francisco Display font off of Github and Inconsolata font. For inconsolata font just use the below pacman command and it will be installed.
#For SFD font install to /usr/share/fonts
#Make sure to get fonts off of https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DejaVuSansMono
#And put them in /usr/share/fonts. This is so powerline properly displays in emacs -nw. Also make sure that this font is in use by emacs--it should be though, because my emacs config uses the powerline version of the font.
